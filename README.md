#MathQuestionGeneratorPython
I used this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/21FnnGKSRZo?si=4FFpCUjm8x0jBD2K) to create a math queston generator.
The generator works by generating a number of math questions (currently set to 10).
It will ask the user these math questions and it does not allow them to move onto the next math question until 
answering the current question correctly.
It also times the total amount of time in seconds that it takes the user to complete all of the questions.
